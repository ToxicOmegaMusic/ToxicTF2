There are a few extra scripts I added in for your pleasure. You can run them at
any time from the console by typing "exec 'script name'", EX: "exec disable_shadows".
Also the game WILL sadly reset ragdolls and shadows to being disabled after restarting
the game unless you change it in the "autoexec.cfg".

Scripts:
fix - Runs all the commands that solve common issues in the game (invisible players, looping sound, etc).
enable_shadows - Enables low quality shadows.
enable_goodshadows - Enables full quality shadows (Used competetively to see players through some walls).
disable_shadows - Disables shadows.
enable_ragdolls - Enables ragdolls and gibs.
disable_ragdolls - Disables ragdolls and gibs.
antiw - "Tries" to kill the player when they press W while rocket jumping. Intended for jump maps.
bettergfx - Enables phong, specularity, bumpmaps, ragdolls, gibs, and max shadows.
worsegfx - Disables phong, specularity, bumpmaps, ragdolls, gibs, and shadows.

Also some binds:
Q - Toggles first person viewmodels.
R - Call for spy.
ALT - Toggles floating health bar, use if you can'y see allies health.
