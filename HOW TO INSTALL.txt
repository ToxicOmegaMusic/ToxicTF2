HOW TO INSTALL:

CUSTOM ASSSETS: First, extract the "custom.zip" using a free extraction
program such as WinRar. Next drag the new "custom" folder into the 
directory: "...\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf". Don't worry if 
the folder already exists because they will merge with only one or two 
natural conflictions, just replace any conflicting files.

SCRIPTS: First, navigate to "...\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf" and delete the 
"cfg" folder". Next, move the new included "cfg" folder to your "tf" folder. If you 
have a five button mouse, replace the pyro, soldier, and spy scripts in the "cfg" 
folder with those from the "5BM" folder.
