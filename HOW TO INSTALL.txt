HOW TO INSTALL:

CUSTOM ASSSETS: First, extract the "custom.zip" using a free extraction
program such as WinRar. Next drag the new "custom" folder into the 
directory: "...\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf". Don't worry if 
the folder already exists because they will merge with only one or two 
natural conflictions, just replace any conflicting files.

SCRIPTS: First, move the "cfg" folder to "...\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf". 
It's up to you if you want to delete the old "cfg" (recommended) or merge with your 
current one. If you have a five button mouse, replace the pyro, soldier, and spy
scripts in the "cfg" folder with those from the "5BM" folder.
