HOW TO INSTALL:

CUSTOM ASSSETS: First, extract the "custom.zip" using a free extraction
program such as WinRar. Next drag the new "custom" folder into the 
directory: "...\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf". Don't worry if 
the folder already exists because they will merge with only one or two 
natural conflictions, just replace any conflicting files.

SCRIPTS: First, navigate to "...\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf". If you have
previously installed scripts it is recommended you delete the "cfg" folder located
here (VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES IF YOU DO THIS). If not, simply drag the included "cfg" folder to the "tf" folder. If you 
have a five button mouse, replace the pyro, soldier, and spy scripts in the "cfg" 
folder with those from the "5BM" folder.

VERIFY GAME FILES:
It's highly recommended you do this if you ever delete your "cfg" folder, or if this is
your first time installing the scripts. Navigate to your steam library, right click on tf2,
and then navigate to the "local files tab" and click "Verify Integrity of Game Files" then
wait for it to finish.
