HOW TO INSTALL:

CUSTOM ASSSETS: 
First, download the custom zip file from http://bit.ly/2nGGQF4 Now that you 
have it, extract the "custom.zip" using any free extraction program such as WinRar. Next 
drag the new "custom" folder into the directory: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf". 
Don't worry if the folder already exists because they will merge with only 
one or two natural conflictions, just replace any conflicting files. I also recommended
wiping this folder if youre updating from an older version of my config.

SCRIPTS: 
Navigate to "...\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf" again. If you have
previously installed scripts it is recommended you delete the "cfg" folder located
here (VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES RIGHT AFTER DOING THIS). If not, simply drag 
the included "cfg" folder to the "tf" folder. If you have a five button mouse, 
replace the pyro, soldier, and spy scripts in the "cfg" folder with those from the 
"5BM" folder.

LAUNCH OPTIONS:
Go to your steam library, right click on Team Fortress 2 and click properties. Next click 
the "SET LAUNCH OPTIONS" button and paste everything the "launch options" text document I included
into the text box that pops up.

VERIFY GAME FILES:
It's highly recommended you do this anytime you delete your "cfg" folder. Navigate 
to your steam library, right click on tf2, select properties, and then navigate 
to the "local files tab" and click "Verify Integrity of Game Files" then wait 
for it to finish.

ENABLE TRANSPARENT VIEWMODELS:
I do not support transparent viewmodels as they are annoying to work with, they take away
a ton of fps, and they aren't easily toggled. However, all required files ARE included.
To enable them, first find your "autoexec.cfg" in your cfg folder. Edit it in notepad and
uncomment the "//exec enable_transparency" by deleting the "//". Now, go to "tf\custom\FlawHUD-master\scripts".
Inside you'll find a file called "hudlayout.res", open it with notepad. If you scroll down a little
you will find a section titled "TRANSPARENT VIEWMODEL" which is incased by two curly braces {}. Inside
that secion you should see two variables which are named "visible" and "enabled" which are currently set
to 0. The last step to enable transparent viewmodels is to simply set them both to 1.
