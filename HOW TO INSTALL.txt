HOW TO INSTALL:

CUSTOM ASSSETS: First, extract the "custom.zip" using a free extraction
program such as WinRar. Next drag the new "custom" folder into the 
directory: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf". 
Don't worry if the folder already exists because they will merge with only 
one or two natural conflictions, just replace any conflicting files.

SCRIPTS: Navigate to "...\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf" again. If you have
previously installed scripts it is recommended you delete the "cfg" folder located
here (VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES IF YOU DO THIS). If not, simply drag the included "cfg" folder to the "tf" folder. If you 
have a five button mouse, replace the pyro, soldier, and spy scripts in the "cfg" 
folder with those from the "5BM" folder.

VERIFY GAME FILES:
It's highly recommended you do this if you ever delete your "cfg" folder, or if this is
your first time installing the scripts. Navigate to your steam library, right click on tf2, 
select properties, and then navigate to the "local files tab" and click
"Verify Integrity of Game Files" then wait for it to finish.

HOW TO USE POTATO COMPUTER GRAPHICS (IGNORE!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS ISNT READY!!!):
If you have framerate issues with the regular config, navigate to the 
"...\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg\" folder. In here there is a file called
"autoexec.cfg". Open this file with your prefered text editor. You should see a line
that has "//exec potatogfx" written. Delete the "//" to uncomment the execution of the
potato graphics script (Leave the "exec gfx" uncommented).
